# upBucket frontend

A basic file-storage system that allows users to save files to Amazon Web
Services. It's a lot like Dropbox, but different... mostly because of the
name.

## Hosted on github pages

## Front End Mockups

The basic layout of the site was decided early on - unlike my other projects,
I wanted this interface to be extremely clean and minimalistic, with few if any
items to interact with besides the main calls to action.

Generally speaking, the final version of the app is true to the mockup, which
mapped out the user flow from login to the main/only page of the app.
